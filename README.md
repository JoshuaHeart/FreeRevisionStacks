# FreeRevisionStacks

A high-level digital resource for IB STEM students (Physics, Math AA, Chemistry). 

## 🎯 Project Mission
The goal of this project is to provide the IB community with "Elite-tier" revision materials that bridge the gap between standard textbook theory and university-level physical application. 

## 🚀 Key Features
- **PFL Challenge Problems:** Original kinematics problems inspired by my experience as a top-scoring athlete in the Philippines Football League (PFL).
- **Calculus-Based Derivations:** Moving beyond memorization to show the mathematical "why" behind physics formulas.
- **LaTeX Integration:** Professional-grade mathematical rendering for clarity and precision.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS
- **Math Rendering:** MathJax (LaTeX)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## 📈 Impact Tracking
I am currently monitoring global usage to provide free resources to students in underserved regions.
